### 🧠 **Project Overview**  
This project aims to predict employee retention using machine learning techniques and data analytics. By identifying key factors that influence an employee’s decision to stay or leave, organizations can make informed, proactive HR decisions to improve workforce stability and reduce turnover costs.

---

This repository presents a machine learning project focused on evaluating and comparing classification models using a real-world dataset. The project implements three different algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, and evaluates them using various performance metrics and visualizations.



## 🔍 Problem Statement

To build and evaluate classification models that can accurately predict the target class. The goal is to identify the most effective algorithm for the dataset using:

- Accuracy
- AUC (Area Under Curve)
- Cross-validation
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- Feature Importance

## ✅ Best Model

| Model           | Accuracy | AUC      |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| 🥇 **Random Forest** | **0.9903**  | **0.9895** |
| Decision Tree   | 0.9763   | 0.9724   |
| Logistic Reg.   | 0.7943   | 0.8280   |

- **Training Accuracy**: 1.0000  
- **Test Accuracy**: 0.9903  
- **Cross-Validation Mean Accuracy**: 0.9909  
- **Overfitting?**: ❌ **No significant signs** — cross-validation and test performance are closely aligned.

## 📊 Visualizations

All plots were generated using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib`:

- Confusion Matrix Heatmaps
- ROC Curves
- Model Comparison Bar Charts
- Feature Importance (Random Forest)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas & NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks
